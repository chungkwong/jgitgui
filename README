JGitGUI is a simple graphical client for git based on JGit(and do not rely on the offical git client).

Pros
  - JGitGUI can run on both windows and *nix(including Mac OS X) since it is pure Java
  - May be more user friendly to people outside *nix world somehow

Cons
  - Not effective for large repository
  - Not all functionality of git is supported

Supported command
  - rm, add, clean, status, commit
  - blame, log, diff
  - branch, checkout, merge
  - tag, note
  - remote, fetch, pull, push

**JGitGUI used Java FX toolkit. JRE (version 8 or later) on Windows plaform already
shiped with that. On *nix, you may need to install OpenJFX package in order to get
JGitGUI work.**
